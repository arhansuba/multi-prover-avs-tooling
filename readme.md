# Multi-Prover AVS Tooling

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing Multi-Prover Attestation Verification Services (AVS) on EigenLayer using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

## Overview

The Multi-Prover AVS Tooling enables developers to deploy contracts, monitor TEE and contract status, and initialize the TEE environment. It leverages Web3.js for Ethereum interactions and includes utility functions for handling TEE operations.

## Features

- **Deploy Contracts**: Deploy Multi-Prover AVS contracts on EigenLayer.
- **Monitor Status**: Monitor TEE and contract events to ensure reliability and integrity.
- **Initialize Environment**: Initialize the TEE environment for secure execution.
